# Project Name

This project is a web application built using Next.js, a popular React framework. It was bootstrapped with `create-next-app`, which sets up a solid base for building complex applications.

The application allows users to browse and favorite movies. The favoriting feature is implemented using a heart icon that changes based on whether the movie is in the user's favorites list or not. 

The project uses Axios for making HTTP requests to fetch data from an external API. For styling, the project leverages Tailwind CSS and SHADCN, which allow for faster and more productive code writing.

To run the project locally, users can clone the repository, install the necessary dependencies, and start the development server. The application will then be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Setup and Running Project Locally

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone <repository-link>`.
2. Navigate to the project directory using `cd <project-name>`.
3. Install the required dependencies using `npm install`.
4. Start the development server using `npm run dev`.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
